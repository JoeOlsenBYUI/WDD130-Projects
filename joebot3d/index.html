                <h2>About JoeBot3D</h2>
                <p>
                    Through the power and magic of 3D printing technology, JoeBot3D makes cool, useful products, such as
                    Wi-Fi QR code placards, lithophanes, and light switch plates for your home. Wi-Fi QR codes are used
                    to
                    easily connect friends to your home Wi-Fi; the placard makes it look good in your home. Lithophanes
                    are
                    3D pictures that only reveal the image in front of a light. Light switch plates are a fun way to
                    make it
                    easy to tell if you're turning on the sink light or the garbage disposal.

                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <p>
                    One upon a time, a very long time ago, I wanted to be a 3D animator. Fortunately, there was a great
                    3D modeling and animation program at the college in the small town where I grew up. So I enrolled in
                    classes and I loved every minute of it. I made glorious 3D creations, and asked my family members
                    for critiques. Usually they were pretty impressed with what I was able to do. I was very proud of my
                    work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There came a point where I decided to serve a as a missionary for the Lord. After two years, I came
                    home. My heart and my mind had changed. I had just spent two years doing the most meaningful work I
                    had ever done. Now, being an animator for Hollywood just didn't seem very meaningful to me anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some time after my mission, I got a job manufacturing parts for 3D printers. It was really
                    interesting. Eventually I obtained a 3D printer for myself. I was able to use the 3D modeling skills
                    I had learned before my mission for 3D printing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love seeing something that I've created on the computer being printed on the 3D printed into a
                    tangible result. I'm glad I get to share this gift with the world.
                </p>
